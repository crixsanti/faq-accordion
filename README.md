<h1 align="center">FAQ Accodion Project</h1>
<p align="center">This simple "Frequently Asked Questions" project is made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript technologies.
<br>
It follows the concept of "forEach" to show/hide the answers when clicking on the questions.
<br>
It was quite difficult for me, as I've never done anything like "show/hide", I had to resort to the internet for help hehe
<br>
An idea from the website frontendmentor.io, thanks for providing page ideas for us!</p>
